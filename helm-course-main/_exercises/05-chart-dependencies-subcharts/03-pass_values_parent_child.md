# Passing Values Between Parent and Subcharts in Helm

Welcome! In this guide, weâ€™ll explore how to effectively pass values from a parent Helm chart to its subcharts. By the end of this exercise, you should be able to implement this technique creatively in your own projects. ðŸŒŸ Letâ€™s dive in!

## Overview

Before jumping into the specifics, here's what you can aim to achieve in this exercise:

1. **Set Up** your base directory and create a new subchart.
2. **Clean Up** the generated subchart files to focus on passing values.
3. **Configure** your `values.yaml` to include custom values.
4. **Establish Dependencies** in your parent chartâ€™s configuration.
5. **Override Values** from the parent chart in the subchartâ€™s context.

Feel free to give it a try on your own before peeking at the step-by-step guide!

## Step-by-Step Guide

Hereâ€™s a straightforward process to implement the passing of values from a parent chart to subcharts:

1. **Create a Subchart:**
   - Navigate to the charts folder within your project directory.
   - Run the `helm create` command to create a new subchart (e.g., `demo subchart`).
2. **Clean the Subchart:**

   - Remove unnecessary files, retaining only what you want to use.
   - Change the `service account` file to a `config map` and make the adjustments in `helpers.tpl`.

3. **Update values.yaml:**

   - Replace its content with a single custom value (e.g., `hello from demo-subchart`).

4. **Edit Chart.yaml:**

   - Add your new subchart as a dependency in your parent chartâ€™s `Chart.yaml`.
   - Specify the version: `0.1.0`.

5. **Run Dependency Update:**

   - Execute `helm dependency update` in the base directory to refresh the dependencies.

6. **Override Values:**

   - Add a new custom value in the parent chart's `values.yaml` (e.g., `hello from config-store`).
   - Nest it under a key that matches your subchart's name.

7. **Verify Changes:**
   - Run `helm template` to confirm that the values from the parent are being correctly passed to the subchart.

## Conclusion

This exercise introduces you to the essential practice of passing values from parent charts to subcharts in Helm. Remember, being able to customize these configurations can significantly improve the flexibility and scalability of your applications. The key takeaway is understanding the importance of maintaining organization and clarity within your configurations. Keep experimenting and honing this skill! ðŸš€
