# Using the Helm Dashboard Plugin

Welcome to this guide on implementing the Helm Dashboard plugin. This plugin is a fantastic tool that helps you visualize and manage your Helm applications within your Kubernetes cluster. Let's dive in!

## Overview

In this exercise, we will implement the Helm Dashboard plugin, allowing us to easily interact with Helm's functionalities through a visual interface. Before getting into the step-by-step guide, hereâ€™s a quick summary of what you'll be doing:

1. Familiarize yourself with community plugins and their management.
2. Locate the Helm Dashboard plugin on GitHub.
3. Install the Helm Dashboard plugin using the Helm command.
4. Start the dashboard and explore its features.
5. Practice uninstalling and reinstalling the plugin, as well as upgrading it.

I encourage you to try implementing the solution on your own before checking out the detailed steps below. Let's see what you can achieve! ðŸš€

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Explore Community Plugins**: Understand that Helm plugins are developed by the community and not part of the core Helm software. Check the [Helm website](https://helm.sh) for the latest plugins.
2. **Find the Helm Dashboard Plugin**: Navigate to the Helm Dashboard GitHub repository, which should have a significant number of stars and active maintenance.

3. **Install the Plugin**:

   - Open your terminal.
   - Run the command:
     ```
     helm plugin install <GitHub_repo_URL>
     ```
   - Confirm the installation was successful.

4. **Launch the Dashboard**:

   - Use the command:
     ```
     helm dashboard
     ```
   - Make sure your Kubernetes cluster is up and running (you may need to start it if it's down).

5. **Explore the Dashboard**: Once the dashboard is running, examine its interface. Try adding repositories, installing charts, and viewing resources.

6. **Manage Plugins**: Practice uninstalling the dashboard with:
   ```
   helm plugin uninstall dashboard
   ```
   Then, reinstall and try upgrading the plugin, using commands like `helm plugin update dashboard`.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! Youâ€™ve successfully learned how to install and use the Helm Dashboard plugin. This tool adds a visual layer to the powerful Helm command-line functionalities. Remember, the more you practice navigating through the dashboard while linking it back to your CLI commands, the more proficient you'll become. Keep exploring and experimentingâ€”thereâ€™s always more to learn! ðŸŒŸ
