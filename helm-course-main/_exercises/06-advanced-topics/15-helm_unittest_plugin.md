# Helm Unit Test Plugin Overview

Welcome! In this guide, we'll dive into the Helm unit test plugin. This resource is meant to help you understand how to efficiently create and run unit tests for your Helm charts.

## Overview

Before we jump into the step-by-step guide, here's what you'll want to try implementing on your own. The main steps to achieving the objectives related to the Helm unit test plugin are:

1. **Check for and install the Helm unit test plugin**.
2. **Create a new Helm chart** for testing.
3. **Set up a test directory** within your chart that follows the naming convention.
4. **Write your first test in YAML format** in the specified test directory.
5. **Run your tests using the Helm CLI** to see how they behave and validate your charts.

Give these steps a shot before checking the detailed guide below! You might surprise yourself with what you can achieve ðŸ˜Š.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Install the Helm Unit Test Plugin**:
   Open your terminal and run the command to install the unit test plugin. (Make sure to check the latest installation command from the Helm documentation).

2. **Create a New Helm Chart**:
   Use the command `helm create unit-test-demo` to create a new Helm chart called "unit-test-demo". Change into this new directory.

3. **Set Up Your Test Directory**:
   Inside the chart directory, create a directory named `test` and follow the naming convention for test files by adding a YAML file, like `first_test.yaml`.

4. **Write Your Unit Test**:
   In the `first_test.yaml`, draft your unit test following the YAML format. Ensure it includes the required structure to validate your chart's deployment.

5. **Run Your Unit Test**:
   Execute `helm unit test` in the terminal to run the test. Check the output to see if your tests have passed or failed.

6. **Modify and Rerun Tests**:
   If your tests initially fail, review the error messages, make necessary adjustments in your chart or test files, and run the tests again. This iterative process is key to finding and fixing issues!

## Conclusion

In this lecture, we explored the Helm unit test plugin, learned how to set up a testing environment, and the importance of writing effective unit tests for our Helm charts. Implementing these tests can significantly enhance your development process by ensuring your templates are properly validated before releasing changes. Keep practicing and exploring the different features of the unit test plugin, and you'll see how it can improve your chart management skills. Happy testing! ðŸš€
