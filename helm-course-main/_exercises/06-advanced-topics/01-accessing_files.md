# Accessing Files in Helm Charts

Welcome! In this guide, we‚Äôll explore how to access and retrieve file contents from within your Helm chart, focusing on implementing a simple yet effective configuration. Before diving into the details, I encourage you to give the implementation a shot on your own. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of what you'll be doing:

## Overview

To successfully access files in your Helm chart, here‚Äôs a high-level summary of the steps you'll need to take:

1. Create a new directory for your Helm chart.
2. Set up the `chart.yaml` file and directory structure (templates and files).
3. Create a simple ConfigMap in `configmap.yaml`.
4. Use the `files.get` function to load data from a local file.
5. Run the Helm template command to verify your implementation.
6. Clean up any formatting issues that arise.

Take a moment to give this a try before moving on to the step-by-step guide! üõ†Ô∏è

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Create a New Directory**: Start by creating a new directory named `accessing-files`.
2. **Set Up `chart.yaml`**:
   - Inside the new directory, create a file named `chart.yaml`.
   - Add the necessary details, like the name as `accessing-files` and a brief description.
   - Remove unnecessary comments for clarity.
3. **Create the Directory Structure**: Inside the `accessing-files` directory, create two new directories: `templates` and `files`.
4. **Create `configmap.yaml`**: In the `templates` directory, create a file called `configmap.yaml`.
   - Define a ConfigMap, setting the API version and kind accordingly.
   - Set metadata for the name using the Helm function to generate a full name.
5. **Load File Contents**:
   - Use the `dot.files.get` function to read contents from a file in the `files` folder (like `application.properties`).
   - Set this data inside the data section of your ConfigMap.
6. **Create the File**: Inside the `files` directory, create `application.properties` and add your desired configuration settings (e.g., server port, logging level).
7. **Run the Helm Template Command**: Back in the terminal, execute the Helm template command to render your templates and confirm that everything works.
8. **Fix Formatting Issues**: If you notice extra lines or indentation issues, refine your ConfigMap to correct these discrepancies.

## Conclusion

You‚Äôve now learned how to access file contents within your Helm chart by creating a simple ConfigMap and loading data from local files. This skill is essential for managing configuration in your applications. Keep practicing this technique, and you‚Äôll become more comfortable with Helm's file access features!

Happy coding! üéâ
