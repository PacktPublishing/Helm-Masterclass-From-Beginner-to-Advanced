# Creating and Implementing Library Charts in Helm

## Overview

In this session, we'll explore the fascinating world of library charts in Helm. Library charts are really handy for providing a reusable set of utilities that can be leveraged by other charts. Before diving into the step-by-step guide, I encourage you to give the implementation a shot on your own! Hereâ€™s a quick summary of the main steps youâ€™ll be trying to implement:

1. Create a new directory for your library charts.
2. Set up a new chart within that directory, commonly known as "common".
3. Change the type of your chart from application to library in the `Chart.yaml` file.
4. Create and customize utility functions using templates.
5. Add your library chart as a dependency in the parent chart.
6. Run `helm dependency update` and check if everything works.

Give it a go! Once youâ€™ve given it your best shot, feel free to look at the step-by-step guide below for additional details. ðŸš€

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Create a Library Chart Directory**: Start by creating a new directory named `library-charts` under your code directory.
2. **Create a Common Chart**: Move into the `library-charts` directory and create a new chart by running:

   ```bash
   helm create common
   ```

3. **Modify the Chart Type**: Open the `Chart.yaml` file in the `common` directory and change the type field from `application` to `library`.

4. **Clean Up Unnecessary Files**: Delete all files inside the `templates` folder and the `values.yaml` file, keeping the folder itself intact.

5. **Create Utility Files**: Create a new template file, perhaps named `_naming.tpl`, and move any necessary functions from the parent chartâ€™s helpers into this file.

6. **Update the Parent Chart**: In the parent chart's `Chart.yaml`, specify `common` as a dependency, pointing to the relative path of your library chart.

7. **Run Dependency Update**: Navigate to the parent chart directory in your terminal and execute:

   ```bash
   helm dependency update
   ```

8. **Test for Errors**: Run the `helm template` command to ensure everything is working correctly and troubleshoot any issues related to naming and referencing.

## Conclusion

Today, we delved into how library charts can streamline our Helm charts by providing reusable utilities. Remember that library charts donâ€™t render Kubernetes resources by themselvesâ€”they just enhance the functionality of your main charts. Keep experimenting with these concepts to deepen your understanding! You're on the right path to mastering Helm charts. ðŸŒŸ
