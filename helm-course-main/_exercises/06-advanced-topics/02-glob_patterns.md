# Exploring File Patterns in Helm Templates

Welcome to the exploration of working with file patterns in Helm templates! In this exercise, we will learn how to retrieve and manage various configuration files using glob patterns, allowing for greater flexibility and efficiency in our templates. ðŸŽ‰

## Overview

The goal of this exercise is to implement a solution that loads multiple configuration files based on their file extension using glob patterns. Before diving into the step-by-step guide, hereâ€™s a summary of the main steps you'll want to follow:

1. Create additional properties files (e.g., `dev.properties` and `prod.properties`) alongside the existing `application.properties`.
2. Modify the content of each properties file as needed.
3. Use the glob pattern to iterate over relevant files in the specified directory.
4. Access and display the contents of each matched file.
5. Adjust the paths and format the output to remove unnecessary prefixes.

Take a moment to try implementing these steps on your own before checking out the detailed guide below. You might surprise yourself with what you can achieve! ðŸ’ª

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Create your properties files**: Add `dev.properties` and `prod.properties` files to your project directory, ensuring they contain relevant configurations.
2. **Modify your configuration**: Change the content of the newly created files, for example, set a debug level in `dev.properties` and an info level in `prod.properties`.
3. **Set up your config map**: Include references to both `dev.properties` and `prod.properties` within your config map setup.
4. **Implement glob pattern**: Use the `range` function together with `files.glob` to create a pattern that matches any `.properties` file in your directory.
5. **Access file contents**: Inside your `range` loop, use the correct method to retrieve the file contents and ensure you're coming from the right scope.
6. **Clean up the output**: Format the output by removing any unnecessary path prefixes using the base function, if needed.
7. **Test your implementation**: Run your Helm templates to ensure that the files are being loaded correctly and displaying the expected results.

## Conclusion

In this lecture, we explored how to implement glob patterns in Helm templates to handle multiple configuration files dynamically. By following the steps above, you have the opportunity to enhance your Helm management skills and experiment further with configurations. Keep practicing, and donâ€™t hesitate to dive deeper into glob patterns for even greater flexibility in your setups!

Happy coding, and enjoy your learning journey! ðŸ˜Š
