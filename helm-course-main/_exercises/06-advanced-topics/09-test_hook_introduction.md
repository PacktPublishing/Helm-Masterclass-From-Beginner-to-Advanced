# Introduction to Helm Test Hooks

Welcome! In this session, we will explore Helm test hooks and see how they integrate with Helm charts. Itâ€™s a great opportunity to get hands-on experience with testing your Kubernetes applications. ðŸš€ Before diving into the step-by-step guide, letâ€™s first summarize what youâ€™ll be implementing.

## Overview

In this exercise, you'll learn how to create a Helm chart that includes a test hook, install it, and execute tests to verify your deployment. Hereâ€™s a quick summary of the steps you should try on your own first:

1. Create a new Helm chart named `test-hook`.
2. Ensure the `service` type in `values.yaml` is set to `ClusterIP`.
3. Inspect the `testconnection.yaml` file, which serves as your basic pod definition.
4. Install your chart locally using Helm.
5. Execute the Helm test command and review the test results.
6. Experiment with modifying the test file and re-running tests to see how changes affect outcomes.

Give these steps a go before checking out the detailed guide!

## Step-by-Step Guide

Hereâ€™s a detailed guide for the steps you should follow:

1. **Create the Helm chart**:
   ```bash
   helm create test-hook
   ```
2. **Check the values.yaml file**:
   Open `values.yaml` and ensure that the service type is set to `ClusterIP`. If not, change it accordingly.

3. **Inspect the test file**:
   Navigate to the `tests` directory and open `testconnection.yaml`. Take note of how itâ€™s structured, especially the annotations.

4. **Install your chart locally**:
   Run the following command to install the chart:

   ```bash
   helm install local-test --name test-hook
   ```

5. **Verify pod creation**:
   Check if the pod is running:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```

6. **Run the test command**:
   Execute the following command to run your test:

   ```bash
   helm test local-test-hook
   ```

7. **Explore test options**:
   Use the `--help` flag to see all available options with the `helm test` command.

8. **Modify the test file**:
   Change a value in `testconnection.yaml` to something invalid, save it, and rerun the test to observe the failure.

9. **Upgrade your release**:
   Any changes to the test files require an upgrade to take effect. Run:

   ```bash
   helm upgrade local-test-hook test-hook
   ```

10. **Check the new test outcome**:
    Rerun the `helm test` command to see the updated results.

## Conclusion

In this lecture, we covered the basics of creating and running tests using Helm test hooks. You've learned how to create a chart, define a test in a YAML file, and execute that test while understanding the feedback provided by Helm. Keep practicing these steps, and you'll become more comfortable with Helm and Kubernetes testing. Always remember to challenge yourself by trying different modifications and exploring additional functionalities!
