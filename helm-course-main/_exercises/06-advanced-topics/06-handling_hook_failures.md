# Understanding Hook Failures in Helm

## Overview

In this exercise, we will explore the behavior of Helm when hooks fail during execution. Hooks are an essential feature in Helm that allow us to run specific commands before or after an upgrade, install, or rollback. However, it's crucial to understand what happens when these hooks don't complete successfully.

Hereâ€™s a quick summary of the steps you can take to implement the solution:

1. Install the Helm release with demo hooks.
2. Modify the hook command to intentionally fail.
3. Observe how the Helm upgrade command handles the failed hook.
4. Experiment with changing the hook type and observing the resource states.
5. Use the `--atomic` flag when upgrading to see the rollback effect in action.

Before looking at the detailed guide, give it a try and see if you can follow the steps above! It could give you a deeper understanding of the concepts. ðŸš€

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Install the Release**: Begin by installing the demo hooks using the Helm install command. Ensure the release is up and running.
2. **Modify the Hook**: Open your hook file and change the command to something that fails, such as `echo "I will fail"` and set the exit code to 1. This simulates a hook failure.
3. **Run Helm Upgrade**: Execute the `helm upgrade` command with your demo hooks. Watch the terminal to see if the upgrade fails, and check the status using `helm history`.

4. **Check Pod States**: Use `kubectl get pods` to observe any pods associated with the failed job. Describe these pods to understand their current state.

5. **Change Hook Types**: Change the hook type from pre-upgrade to post-upgrade in your hook file. Repeat the helm upgrade and observe the difference.

6. **Use the --atomic Flag**: Finally, try adding the `--atomic` flag to your upgrade command. This should enable automatic rollback if your hook fails.

## Conclusion

Through this exercise, we learned how helm hooks interact with the release process and what occurs when they fail. Itâ€™s essential to grasp these concepts to manage resources effectively in Kubernetes. Remember, when a pre-hook fails, the entire command will halt, but with the `--atomic` flag, we can safeguard against broken states by ensuring rollbacks occur to the last stable revision.
