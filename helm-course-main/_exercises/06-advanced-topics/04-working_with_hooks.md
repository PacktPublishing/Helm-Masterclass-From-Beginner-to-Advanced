# Working with Helm Hooks

## Overview

In this exercise, we will dive into creating and utilizing hooks in Helm for managing Kubernetes jobs effectively. The goal is to implement a backup job that runs before upgrades, deletions, or rollbacks of a Helm release. By doing so, you are introducing an essential practice for maintaining data integrity during application updates. ðŸ™Œ

Hereâ€™s a quick outline of the main steps weâ€™ll cover:

1. Create a new Helm chart dedicated to hooks.
2. Set up a Kubernetes job with proper annotations to define it as a Helm hook.
3. Modify deployment configurations to include these hooks.
4. Execute the Helm install and observe hook behavior during upgrades.
5. Manage hook deletion policies and understand their implications.

Before moving on to the step-by-step guide, I encourage you to give these steps a try on your own! You might surprise yourself with what you can accomplish!

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Create a new Helm chart**:

   - Use the command line to create a new Helm chart folder and name it something like `helm-hooks`.

2. **Define the Kubernetes job**:

   - In the new chart directory, create a `backup-db.yaml` file under a new folder called `hooks`.
   - Specify the job's metadata, including name and labels, while ensuring to add the necessary Helm hook annotations:
     - `helm.sh/hook: pre-upgrade, pre-delete, pre-rollback`
     - `helm.sh/hook-weight: <desired weight>`
     - `helm.sh/hook-delete-policy: before-hook-creation or hook-succeeded`

3. **Configure the job specifications**:

   - Define the job specifications inside `backup-db.yaml`, setting the correct image and commands to simulate a backup.

4. **Install and Upgrade**:

   - Use `helm install` to deploy your chart. After that, introduce changes to your chart or values and use `helm upgrade` to see your hook in action.

5. **Adjust and Test Hook Policies**:
   - Experiment with different `hook-delete-policies` to understand how they affect the lifecycle of the job.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you've learned how to set up and utilize Helm hooks effectively in your Kubernetes deployments. This capability is not just a best practice; itâ€™s a vital skill for ensuring smooth operations during application deployments and updates. Keep exploring and practicing these concepts, as mastering hooks will significantly enhance your Helm proficiency!
