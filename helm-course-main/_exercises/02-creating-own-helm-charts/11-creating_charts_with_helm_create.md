# Creating Charts with Helm

## Overview

In this exercise, we'll explore how to utilize the Helm command `helm create` to streamline the creation of Helm chart files. Instead of creating each file manually, we'll leverage this command to generate everything we need automatically. This is a great opportunity to put your skills to the test! Before diving into the step-by-step guide, try to implement the solution on your own using the following summary of main steps:

1. Navigate to your desired directory for creating your Helm chart.
2. Run the command `helm create <chart name>` (replace `<chart name>` with your choice, like `backend-app`).
3. Explore the generated files and folders to understand their structure and content.
4. Familiarize yourself with the contents of `Chart.yaml`, `values.yaml`, and the templates created.
5. Take note of any concepts related to Go Templates that might need further exploration.

Take your time to implement these steps yourself before looking at the detailed guide below. ðŸš€

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Open your terminal** and navigate to the directory where you want to create your Helm chart.

   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/directory
   ```

2. **Run the HelmCreate command** to generate your chart files. You can choose any appropriate name for your chart.

   ```bash
   helm create <your chart name>
   ```

   For example:

   ```bash
   helm create backend-app
   ```

3. **Review the generated files and structure.** Check the new directory created for your chart. You should see several files and subdirectories, including:

   - `Chart.yaml`
   - `values.yaml`
   - `templates/`

4. **Inspect `Chart.yaml`.** Open this file to see the documentation and metadata that has been automatically populated for your chart.

5. **Examine `values.yaml`.** This file will contain default configuration values for your applications, which you can modify according to your needs.

6. **Explore the `templates/` directory.** Inside, youâ€™ll find multiple template files for Kubernetes resources. Pay special attention to how Go Templates are used to streamline the deployment configuration.

7. **Understand the Go Templates.** If some concepts are unclear, take the time to review online resources or upcoming lectures to fill in those gaps. We will explore Go Templates in much more depth in the upcoming lectures, so don't worry if something is not clear now!

## Conclusion

In this exercise, we learned how to efficiently create Helm charts using the `helm create` command. This not only saves time but also helps us create a well-structured deployment. Remember, the auto-generated files are a great resource to familiarize yourself with Kubernetes components and Go Templates. Keep practicing, explore the templates further, and donâ€™t hesitate to dig deeper into any concepts that need clarification. Happy charting! ðŸŽ‰
