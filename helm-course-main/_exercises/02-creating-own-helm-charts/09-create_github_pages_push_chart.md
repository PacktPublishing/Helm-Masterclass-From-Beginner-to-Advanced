# Creating GitHub Pages to Publish Helm Charts

## Overview

Welcome! In this guide, we'll walk through the process of setting up a GitHub repository and enabling GitHub Pages to publish your Helm charts on a public URL. ðŸš€ Before diving into the step-by-step instructions, let's first consider what youâ€™ll be working on.

The main goal of this exercise is to create a public GitHub repository, set it up for GitHub Pages, and publish your Helm charts so they are accessible via a URL. Hereâ€™s a quick summary of what you should aim to implement:

1. Create a new public GitHub repository without a template.
2. Enable GitHub Pages by selecting the â€˜mainâ€™ branch as the source.
3. Clone the repository locally and prepare your Helm charts.
4. Index your charts to generate an index.yaml file.
5. Commit and push your changes to the remote repository to publish your updates.

Take a moment to try implementing this process on your own before checking out the detailed steps below!

## Step-by-Step Guide

Hereâ€™s a clear step-by-step guide to help you set up your GitHub repository and publish your Helm charts:

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**:

   - Go to GitHub and select "New Repository."
   - Name it (e.g., `helm-charts`) and provide a short description.
   - Set it as a **public repository** and add a README file. Use the **MIT license** for permissions.
   - Click on "Create repository."

2. **Enable GitHub Pages**:

   - Navigate to the **Settings** of your repository.
   - Scroll to the **Pages** section in the left-side menu.
   - Select the **main branch** as your source and save the settings.

3. **Clone Your Repository**:

   - Use SSH or HTTPS to clone the repository to your local machine, ensuring it's in a directory that is not part of any existing Git repository.

4. **Move Your Helm Chart**:

   - Locate your Helm chart (e.g., `nginx-0.1.0.tgz`) and move it to your cloned `helm-charts` folder.

5. **Index the Chart**:

   - In your `helm-charts` folder, run the command `helm repo index .` to create an `index.yaml` file that lists all available charts.

6. **Commit and Push Changes**:

   - Use Git to add your new files (`index.yaml` and the chart file).
   - Commit your changes with a message (e.g., `feat(nginx): publish nginx chart version 0.1.0`).
   - Push the changes back to the remote repository.

7. **Access Your Published Charts**:
   - Go back to the GitHub Pages URL created for your repository.
   - Verify that your `index.yaml` and chart files are accessible via this URL.

## Conclusion

Fantastic job! You've just learned how to set up a public GitHub repository, enable GitHub Pages, and publish your Helm charts for anyone to access. This is a valuable skill that will help you in sharing your projects in a professional and efficient manner.
