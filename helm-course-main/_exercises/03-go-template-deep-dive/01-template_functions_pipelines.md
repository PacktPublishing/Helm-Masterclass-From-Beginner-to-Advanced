# A Deep Dive into Template Functions and Pipelines

## Overview

Welcome! In this session, weâ€™ll be exploring the intriguing world of template functions and pipelines in Helm. Get ready to roll up your sleeves and dive into some exciting Go templating features! ðŸŒŠ

The purpose of this exercise is to implement and understand various functions available within Helm's templating system and how to use these functions effectively to manipulate data in Helm charts. Before you proceed to the step-by-step guide, hereâ€™s a brief summary of the steps youâ€™ll want to take:

1. **Create a new folder**: Set up a working environment by creating a `templating-deep-dive` folder.
2. **Copy necessary files**: Copy the files from the introductory Go templating folder to your new folder.
3. **Adjust chart and values**: Rename the chart and confirm your values are set up correctly.
4. **Explore functions**: Begin experimenting with string, dictionary, and list functions found in the Helm documentation.
5. **Implement pipelines**: Use pipelines to pass data between functions and result in valid YAML output.

Take a shot at implementing the above steps before checking out the detailed guide. It's a great way to reinforce your learning!

## Step-by-Step Guide

Hereâ€™s a more detailed process for you to follow as you delve into template functions and pipelines:

1. **Create a New Folder**:

   - Set up a new folder for your project, named `templating-deep-dive`.

2. **Copy Files**:

   - Navigate to the intro Go templating folder and copy the necessary files into your new folder to establish the project structure.

3. **Adjust the Chart**:

   - Open the `Chart.yaml` file and rename the chart to `templating-deep-dive`. Double-check to make sure the values file is correct.

4. **Explore Helm Functions**:

   - Familiarize yourself with Helmâ€™s template functions, especially the string, dictionary, and list operations. Try to understand how to manipulate data types through the provided functions.

5. **Work with Pipelines**:
   - Experiment with the use of pipelines in Helm. Understand how the output from one function can serve as input for another. Focus on indentation and how it affects the validity of YAML.

This guide should set you on the right path as you explore and implement Helm's templating features.

## Conclusion

Today, we covered the fascinating capabilities of Helm's template functions and how to manage pipelines effectively. We learned about various data manipulation techniques and the importance of maintaining proper indentation for valid YAML output. As you continue your journey, practicing these concepts will greatly enhance your understanding of Helm and Go templating. Keep experimenting and exploringâ€”thereâ€™s always more to learn! ðŸš€
