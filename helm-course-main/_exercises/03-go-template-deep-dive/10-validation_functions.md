# Input Validation Functions in Helm

## Overview

Welcome to the guide on using input validation functions in Helm! In this lecture, weâ€™ll explore essential functions to ensure that the values we receive when generating templates are valid. This is crucial since proper validation can prevent deployment failures and enhance user experience by providing clear feedback on misconfigurations.

Before diving into the detailed steps, I encourage you to try implementing the solution on your own. Here's a quick overview of what you need to do:

1. Check if the `securityContext` is enabled.
2. Validate that specific required values (`runAsUser`, `fsGroup`) are provided when `securityContext` is enabled.
3. Utilize the `required` function to validate these values in your deployment template.
4. Use the `fail` function to enforce more advanced conditions, such as not allowing `runAsUser` to be zero.
5. Consider formatting your error messages for clarity and usability.

Take a moment to try this on your own, and then refer to the step-by-step guide below!

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Define Required Values**: In your `deployment.yaml`, check if `securityContext.enabled` is true.
2. **Implement Required Checks**:
   - Add a check for `runAsUser`, using the `required` function.
   - Add a similar check for `fsGroup`.
3. **Suppress Output**: Assign the result of the required checks to a dummy variable to avoid printing values in the rendered template.
4. **Test Validations**:
   - Run your Helm template and observe the validation in action by temporarily removing `runAsUser`.
5. **Enhance with Fail Function**: Implement the `fail` function to ensure that `runAsUser` is not equal to zero, providing a clear error message if this occurs.
6. **Format Error Messages**: Consider outputting your error messages in JSON format for better readability or machine processing.

## Conclusion

In this lecture, we covered the importance of input validation when working with Helm templates. We learned to implement the `required` and `fail` functions effectively, ensuring that our configurations are correct and user-friendly. Validation is a key element in enhancing deployment reliability and user experience. Keep practicing these techniques to become more proficient in managing Helm templates! ðŸš€
